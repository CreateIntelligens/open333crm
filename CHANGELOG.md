## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Initialized with `pnpm` workspaces and `Turborepo`.

- **Automation Core**: Integrated `json-rules-engine` for Drools-like rule evaluation (`packages/automation`).
- **API Skeleton**: Fastify server with JWT, CORS, and WebSocket support (`apps/api`).
- **Web Skeleton**: Next.js 15 (App Router) dashboard with Tailwind CSS (`apps/web`).

- **Infrastructure**: `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and Caddy.
- **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated linting and building.

### Changed
- **Architectural Pivot**: Moved from record-level multi-tenancy (`tenantId` per row) to a **Single-tenant Group Mode**.
